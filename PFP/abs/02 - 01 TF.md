# Tagless final

Method of embedding DSL in a typed functional host language.

One of colutions to expression problem.

```
Expression problem - how to define a data abstraction that is extensible both in representations and behaviors where we could add repr. or beh. without recompiling existing code and having type safety.
```

## Why TF?

We could use `IO` directly in the entire application. But it would break the principle of least power. Also this leads us to basic OOP recommendation of coding to the interface instead of implementation.

For example, by using `[F[_]: Monad: Timer]` instead of `[IO]` which clearly have `Timer` implementation we could define our own `Timer` for tests.

Also `IO` contains much more things inside it aside from `Timer`. So we can't reason about functions which are using IO directly.

## Summary

TF should be used to encode:
  - Typeclasses (`Monad`, `Apply`, etc); 
  - common/capability traits (such as `ContextShift`, `Timer`, `Clock`, etc)

TF should not be used to maintain every implicit in the app.
